# Computer_vision_transfer_learning

An Analytical Vidhya computer vision hackathon named 'Emergency vs Non-Emergency Vehicle Classification' to classify an image of the vehicle into two categories 
Emergency Vehicle
Non-Emergency vehicle

Dataset can be downloaded from https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/janatahack-computer-vision-hackathon

It contains  2352 images for both emergency and non-emergency vehicle
used 950 images include both emergency and non-emergency vehicle

Used the Xception model which is a pre-trained model. It is trained on the ImageNet dataset which is a dataset of 1000 different categories of data. It is available in the Keras.applications library. 
I used the Xception model because its results for the Imagenet dataset are better than many other pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, etc. 

Got 0.9270 scores in the Hackathon
